# wondermagick benchmarks

We compare `wondermagick` against `imagemagick` in their default configurations. 

Note that you could improve the performance of both of them using arcane compilation flags. We're not going to do that here. The point of this comparison is to show what kind of performance a non-expert user might expect.
